   <p1 style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Reading helps with a lot but reading isn't everything. I mean sure it has its benefits but it can only take you so far.<br/>I had a friend who read all day and night. He was hardworking always devoted to his work. We all knew his future was safe.<br/>Sorry to burst your bubble but he got hit by a bus and now he's paralyzed,poor soul<br/>Moral of the story,Reading will help you reach where you want but it can never stop a bus from hitting you.</p1>
